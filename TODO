Development To-Do List

* get rid of leading spaces in template output
* let user specify a leading/pre-pended portion of a table name, like
  my 'sleet' example (sleet_projects instead of projects)
* drop 's' at the end of names where neeeded; replace 'ies' with 'y'
* more and better templates
  * also create my own form style sheet api, or use the Rails or
    Cake CSS naming conventions
* better accounting for data types and database field names
  * textarea instead of text field (if i can detect varchar size, or related types)
  * drop-downs, checkboxes, and radio buttons where appropriate
  * date field widget based on type and/or field name
* handle the plural to singular conversions Cake and Rails handle
* clean up the root directory
